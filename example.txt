The Bahamas {
  The Bahamas /bəˈhɑːməz/ (Taino: Borike'n, 'Great Land of the Valiant & Noble
  Lord'), officially the Commonwealth of The Bahamas, is an island country
  consisting of more than 700 islands, cays, and islets in the Atlantic Ocean;
  north of Cuba and Hispaniola (the Dominican Republic and Haiti); northwest of
  the Turks and Caicos Islands; southeast of the U.S. state of Florida and east
  of the Florida Keys. Its capital is Nassau on the island of New Providence.
  The designation of "Bahamas" can refer to either the country or the larger
  island chain that it shares with the Turks and Caicos Islands. As stated in
  the mandate/manifesto of the Royal Bahamas Defence Force, the Bahamas 
  territory encompasses 470,000 km<sup>2</sup> (180,000 sq mi) of ocean space.

  Originally inhabited by the Lucayan, a branch of the Arawakan-speaking Taino
  people, the Bahamas were the site of Columbus' first landfall in the New
  World in 1492. Although the Spanish never colonized the Bahamas, they shipped
  the native Lucayans to slavery in Hispaniola. The islands were mostly
  deserted from 1513 until 1648, when English colonists from Bermuda settled
  on the island of Eleuthera.

Lucayan Archipelago {
  The Lucayan Archipelago, or Bahama Archipelago, is an archipelago comprising
  `{the Bahamas} and the Turks and Caicos Islands. The archipelago is in the
  western Atlantic Ocean, north of the Antilles, east and southeast of Florida,
  and north of the equator.

  William Keegan writes that the Bahama archipelago includes the territories
  of both the Commonwealth of the Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands,
  adding: "Modern political considerations aside, the islands form a single
  archipelago with common geological, ecological, and cultural roots." Because
  the nations of the Lucayan Archipelago do not border the Caribbean Sea, they
  are technically part of the West Indies (specifically the British West
  Indies) but not the Caribbean. They are, however, often grouped with
  Caribbean nations for convenience.
