Because the nations of the Lucayan Archipelago do not border the Caribbean Sea, they are technically part of the West Indies (specifically the British West Indies) but not the Caribbean. They are, however, often grouped with Caribbean nations for convenience.</p><p>See also:</p><ul><li><p>Antilles</p></li><li><p>Caribbean</p></li><li><p>West Indies</p></li></ul></li><li><a name="the-bahamas"></a><p><strong>The Bahamas: </strong>The Bahamas /bəˈhɑːməz/ (Taino: Borike'n, 'Great Land of the Valiant & Noble Lord'), officially the Commonwealth of The Bahamas, is an island country consisting of more than 700 islands, cays, and islets in the Atlantic Ocean; north of Cuba and Hispaniola (the Dominican Republic and Haiti); northwest of the Turks and Caicos Islands; southeast of the U.S. state of Florida and east of the Florida Keys. Its capital is Nassau on the island of New Providence. The designation of "Bahamas" can refer to either the country or the larger island chain that it shares with the Turks and Caicos Islands. As stated in the mandate/manifesto of the Royal Bahamas Defence Force, the Bahamas territory encompasses 470,000 km<sup>2</sup> (180,000 sq mi) of ocean space.</p><p>Originally inhabited by the Lucayan, a branch of the Arawakan-speaking Taino people, the Bahamas were the site of Columbus' first landfall in the New World in 1492. Although the Spanish never colonized the Bahamas, they shipped the native Lucayans to slavery in Hispaniola. The islands were mostly deserted from 1513 until 1648, when English colonists from Bermuda settled on the island of Eleuthera.</p><p>See also:</p><ul><li><p>Outline of the Bahamas (the outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to the Bahamas)</p></li><li><p>Legislative council (the name given to the legislatures, or one of the chambers of the legislature of many nations and colonies.)</p></li><li><p>Lucayan Archipelago (an archipelago comprising of the Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands)</p></li></ul></li></ul>
